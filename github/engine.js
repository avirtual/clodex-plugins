/**
 * github — engine half. One intent verb, `[agent:gh …]`.
 *
 * READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. Every sub-command in SUBS reads or renders
 * locally. Nothing here pushes, and a bare `pr` refuses rather than falling
 * back to the dry run — see REFUSE_PR. Do not add a write path of any kind,
 * including an issue comment/close/edit behind a flag: those are the operator's,
 * and an agent verb that acts outward is hard to reverse.
 *
 * CREDENTIALS: THERE ARE NONE, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. `host.storage` is
 * plaintext JSON with no mode bits (plugins/plugin-api.md §4) and `host.settings`
 * lives in the user's UI settings, so this plugin holds no secret at all: no
 * token setting, no token in storage, none in argv, none in the environment it
 * constructs (proc.js). Authentication is `gh`'s own, in the operator's
 * keychain. If gh is not logged in the honest answer — and the one the agent
 * gets — is "the operator must run `gh auth login`", NOT a prompt for a token
 * this plugin has nowhere safe to put.
 *
 * SYNCHRONY (§7): handlers are synchronous, and a returned promise is logged and
 * ignored — its rejection escapes every guard, so failure becomes silence. The
 * handler does the synchronous part and schedules the rest, injecting the answer
 * when it lands. Nothing here returns a promise to the host.
